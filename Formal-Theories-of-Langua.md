## Lecture 3:

### Introduction:
1. deep structure
2. transformation changes deep structure <br>
into surface structure
3. A syntax for a languge consists of: <br>
• deep structure <br>
• surface structure <br>
• transformation <br>

### Against Deep Structure:

(49) John gave a book to Bill <br>
(50) Bill recieved a book from John <br>
1. Here one cannot show that they mean the same due <br>
"gave" and "recieve" as  semantically the same, but <br>
syntactically different. 
2. You can prove that Deep structure not deep enough, <br> or that Deep structure is too deep. <br>

Either make it more semantic, no deep strucutre <br>
Or state that deep structure has a deeper set of <br>
primitives <br>

### Theory of meaning: Meaning = Entailments ?
1. just as in text. 
2. pragamtic factors add entailments which are not semantic <br>
3. semantic vs logical entailment: <br>
— if u try to apply addition: p -> p v q <br>
— then many strange things happen. <br>
— many things can be deduced from a sentence <br>
but are not part of the meaning of a sentence <br>
4. the problem is that semantics and logic <br>
part ways. The meaning of 1+1=2 is euqal with <br>
the meaning of complex equation according to <br>
logic. However, we know this is not the case. <br>

## Lecture 4

2. One problem with entailments: they can go add <br>
infinity.  
3. There is a sub-structure regarding this entailment.
4. Filtering out the entailments central to <br>
the sentence and those which are not.
5. Pragmatics also influences which entailments <br>
are more important. <br>
grammatically unspecified entailments: <br>
(a) if meaning=entailments, the meaning of a w needs <br>
to state how the meaning contributes to the set of <br>
entailments of a sentence X. <br>
6. Davidson tries to limit entailments, to not <br>
go add infinitum in them. His answer is charity <br>
and a holistic view on language. 
7. the solution of this entailment theory is to <br>
disect sentences based on their syntactical entailments <br> and their semantic/pragmatical entialments. Even <br> if to sentences entail each other, it does <br>
not mean that they have the same meaning, this is <br>
explained by the above. 

### Donald Davidson:
1. He died in 2003. 
2. Davidson was a student of Quine.
3. Frege:
    1. A meaning of a sentence=the conditions under which <br> it is true. 
    2. 'sense' and 'reference' distinction. <br>
    sense=meaning; reference=the truth or the false.
4. Idea from Quine: language should be understood <br>
hilistically. The theory of language needs to be <br>
empirically founded. 
5. Davidson's theory of language is based on Tarski. 
    1. enumaration of the semantic properties of <br>
    the vocabulary.
    2. Deducing an infinite set of sentences from <br>
    a finite case.
    3. Davidson applied Tarski's formal theory to <br>
    natural langauge. 
    4. The idea of convention T. 
        1. The idea of object-language and meta-language.
        2. s is *T* if and only if p. 
    5. Davidson's idea is meant not only for <br>
    a meta and obj language which is logical, <br>
    but to a perfect 1 to 1 correspondence <br>
    between the meta and the obj language. 
6. Charity=when interpreting another <br>
one should assume that other believes similar oneself. 

#### On pragmatics:
1. compositionality
2. individual words must not have words at all.
3. Words do not have meaning besides the <br>
effect they have on the sentence. 
4. Davidson is against reference. <br>
Declarative sentences = are always more than 1 word.<br>
Meaning is not about things, but about the context <br>
of utterence. <br>
we understand sentences based on the context.


## Lecture 5

#### Extension vs Intention:
1. x, y are extensionally identical <br> 
   iff x, y refer to the same object <br>
2. x, y are intentionaly identical <br>
   iff they have the same properties.  <br>

**The Slinghsot Problem:** <br>
a. the idea is that extensionaly identical <br>
   terms have the same meaning. <br>
b. the reference to the object = meaning = <br>
   correspondentism. <br>
c. Problem with referential theories: <br>
   All true sentences seem to have the  <br>
   same meaning because they refer to the true <br>
   1. The problem above arises because <br>
      in this theory, *truth is related with refference*, <br> and this leads to 
      undersirable predictions. 
        1. all true sentences refer to the same fact
        2. All true senteces mean the same thing.
            1. Two influencing factors:
                1. principle of extensionality
                2. correspodentism
                    1. meaning in terms of *an* <br>
                       object out there they are <br>
                       about. 
    2. Davison wants to be have a referential <br>
       theory without such problem --> rejects <br>
       correspondentism. 
       1. denies correspondence = reference relation
       2. Thus, for D meaning is an inter 

#### Donald D against intentionality
1. Quine and D call intentional objects <br>
   creatures of darkness since they do <br>
   not have a real ontology. 
2. If u do not know the extesion/intention distinction <br> see Frege's "the morning star is the evening star"<br> example
3. property = intention
4. extension = the set of things that refer


Redefining what reference means, <br>
Davidson. Deniying correspondence. <br>

Wergein in his theory will include intentions <br>
— Davidson calls intentional theoryes <br>
  the reification of things. <br>
  a. res = thing. To thingyfy meaning. <br>
  b. this is what D is against <br>


1. logically equivalanet sentences have same reference
2. ergo, one can apply substitution to them.
3. From this results: <br>
    1. 'x=x'='grass is green'<br>
    2. (1)Anthony killed Cicero and The set of all 
        things equal with themselves
      
        = (2)the set of things that are equal with themselves. <br>
        1. the two sentences are logically equivalent.      <br>
        2. (2) is true iff (1) is true, if Anthony <br>
           did not kill Cicero, then (1) turns out to <br> be false
        3. The set of all things identical with <br>
           themselves icludes everything.
         4. 



#### Extra Explanation of Slingshot Problem
1. if truth = meaning,
2. and truth = reference
3. Then: all true x have the same value <br>
        x is refering = x has meaning 1  <br>
        x is not refering = x has menaing 0. <br>
        
## Lecture 8:
1. Slinghshot argument shows that if these <br>
   three things are true, than all true sentences <br>
   refer to the same thing.
   1. Logical equivalanece
   2. extensionalism
   3. correspondance theory
2. Remove slinghshot:
   1. to remove equivalance (not desirable)
   2. to remove correspondance (Davidson)
   3. to remove extensionalism (and introduce <br> intetionalism)

   people acquire language by observing <br>
   the context of a sentence deptermines what the meanings are<br>
   words have meaning only the context of the sentence <br>

### Davidson and Truth

Truth = truth of that state of affairs <br>
truth ≠ that state of affairs<br>
Truth = a property of that state of affairs. <br>

1. For davidson, he is not a corespondentist, <br>
   truth are not behavioural entities, even if <br>
   Davidson uses behaviour to understand the world. <br>
   Davidson believes that it is inherit in our behaviour <br> 
2. Ss by default true = default enables us to survive <br> and this does not mean corresponding to facts. 
3. Davidson argues that this survival apt behavioru <br>
    ≠ refering to entities out there, peoplec can <br>
    doubt this

### Other theories:
1. pragmatism: symbols used in a social context
   1. here is Davidson 
2. psychologistic: language refers to mental facts
3. denotation (correspondentism)
   1. it explais link between information content <br>
      an the link between symbols = the aboutness of <br> language. 
         1. names = refer to objects
            1. real objects
            2. fictional objects
            3. abstract objects
         2. verb = refer to properties, relations

4. problem with denotatio"
   1. to see how quantifiers

5. IF sentences use aboutness = they cannot be uttered without 
6. productivity = reference

## Lecture 6
1.  B(p) is true iff p 
   1. T-schema
   2. using logic as a meta-language to describe <br>
      the meaning of sentences. 
2. Truth is part of meaning, but is not the whole:
   1. speech acts are not about truth etc. 
   2. Knowing truth = neccesary and not suficent for     
       meaning. 
3. Main function of language = to provide info about <br>
   states of affair. 


Logically analysing sentences <br>
Start with a fragmet and then extended it: <br>
—all fragments contianing just noun and verb.<br>
U do a formal theory for that <br>
Afeterwards you do a biger theory to incoroprate <br>
adjuectives and the rest. 

### How to build such a theaory#
Syntactical rules transformed into semantic rules<br>
sentence parts transfosrmed into logical language. <br>
This is based on compositionality and recusivity. <br>

The formal theory allows you to select an intereptation <br> of ambigous sentence — to disambiguate them by <br>
choosing an interpretation. <br>
<P>
First step establish the syntactical parts: <br>
(a) nouns <br>
(b) verbs (transitive/intransitive) <br>
Maping the truth values of these instantiated parts: <br>

Is boring = the set of boring individuals <br>
Is boring in v = v is the domain <br>
To like = intransitive verb = to place predicate <br>
Set theory constructs <br>
In two place predicates, the members inside <br>
the set have a placing order = ordererd set. <br>

1. defining logical operators:
   1. theyy do not refer to individuals or set of <br>individuals
   2. they map truth values on truth v = its a function
2. to build the meaning, u chage from transitive to <br>intransitive verb, before ending the interpretation. 
3. U need to already have an inuition <br>
   that a sentence is vague before you are interpreting <br> that specific sentence: before u explain <br>
   the vaugeness in the system
   1. if a sentence leads to 2 different truth values, <br> then it is vauge. 

Logic does not tell why logic itself is consistent <br>
Logic aims to model intuition of speakers, not replace <br> them

## Lecture 7:
1. wholism and compositionality putting together <br>
    under a theoretical model. 
    1. abstraction =
        1. the capacity to transform the wholistic <br>
           meaning of a sentence with the meaning of <br>
           of each word: starts to recognise from the context <br>
           the individual words. 
    2. wholism = 
        1. Baby knows what a sentence means as a whole, but not the <br>
           the meaning of its parts. 
  
 #### The semantics of Predicate logic:
 1. quantification (see wiki about it)
        1. Stating that all elements in a set in the domain x is 
        2. a class can be included in another class (like Matrioshka dolls)
        3. 19 page 100 (reader 2 first text): the variabiltiy of meanings: <br>
            1. the idea is that a variable has a different <br>
               truth value depending on the time and context<br>
               it takes place:
                1. t1=at time 1; t2=at time 2
