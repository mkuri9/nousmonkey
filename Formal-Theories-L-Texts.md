## Reading 2: Chomsky: Modern Linguistics

### Transformations:
Besides phase-structures, there are transformations.<br>
A transformation is a rule that allows x to be moved <br>
around in a syntactical sentence and motve x around <br>
systematically, only in a specific manner. <br>

<P>The first case is that of the transformation for <br>
quantifiers. It states that the quantifier (all) can <br>
take place in various places along the phrases, but <br>
it cannot appear twice in a sentence. <br>

#### Advantage of transformations:
1. it prevents the appearance of ungramatical cases <br>
of sentences with more than one quantifier <b4>
2. it simplifies semantic rules. <br>
The position of the quantifier is irrelevant semantically <br>
because the rule enables one to establish the meaning <br>
of the synonimous statements without including the <br>
transformation as a semantic proccess. <br>

#### Types of Transformation:
1. Movement transformation. 
<br> Example: <br> 
— transformation of quantifier <br>
2. Bounded transformation. <br> 
Quantifier transformation is bounded to  a clause, <br>
it cannot move a quantifier to another clause. <br>
3.  Boundless transformations. <br>
Examples: <br>
— transformation of a declerative into a question. <br>
— transformations in forming relative clauses <br>
— transformation in topicalised sentences <br>
4. Transformations can also delete items <br>
Example: <br>
— transformation of erasing two identical verbs <br>
as in "I ate pie and you ate pie". <br>
• Thus all clauses contain a verb. <br>
• Thus "I ate pie and you pie" and "I ate pie and <br>
"you ate pie" are syntactically related. <br>
• Since both are syntactically related --> they <br>
she the same semantic analysis = synonimous <br>
5. Transformations can add items: <br>
Examples: <br>
— Subject-verb agreement rule <br>
• If the subject is singular, v is singular. <br>
• If the subject is plural, v is plural <br>

#### Conclusion for Transformations:
1. Grammer has these elements: <br>
— syntax  <br>
— semantics <br>
— phonetics <br>
• semantics and phonetics have acces <br>
to the autput of syntax, but not the other way <br>
around <br>
2.The components of syntax: <br>
— phrase structure rules <br>
• states the basic combinations of syntactic <br>
categories permisible <br>
• filters can be applied to rule out ungrammatical <br>
cases <br>
• phrase structure rules=the deep structre of english. <br>
— transformations <br>
• It converts trees produced by phrase-structure rules <br> into other trees. <br>
• transformations are structure-dependennt: <br>
• — strings analysed into syntactical category <br>
• — its constituents determine its applicability. <br>
• The output of transformations forms the *surface structure*. <br>
2. Surface/Deep structure and semantics/phonetics: <br> —The out relevant for the phonetical level is the <br>
surface structure. <br>
— The answer is not clear cut with semantics: <br>
• semantics uses both surface and deepr structure <br>
• — semantic uses deep structure mainly. <br>
• — semantic uses surface structure since: <br>
(a) trasnformations can make its job easier. <br> 
(b) phonetic intonation plays a role <br>

### Argument's against Deep Structure

#### Alternatives to Deep Structure:
1. Generative semantics: <br>
— syntactic-semantic rules take semantics as their imput <br>
— have surface structure as the output with no deep  structure. <br>
2. Interpretative semantics: <br>
— transfering more and more of the work of syntactic <br>
rules into the semantic component. <br>
— deep structure has moved nearer and nearer to <br>
surface structure. <br>

#### Arguments against deep structure:
1. Deep structure is not deep enough. <br>
— If one believes that the original arguments for <br>
deep structure are correct, then is forced, by <br>
arguments of the same type, to conclude that <br>
deep structures are deeper than was first thought. <br>
— deep structure does not include all cases in which <br>
one would attribute to a sentence a deep structure: <br>
• first example, passive synthesis. <br>
• semantic synonimous meaning: <br> 
• — some believe that deep structure needs to explain <br> such cases <br>
— If a sentence has 2/more meanings, then it must <br>
have 2/more deep structures. <br>
— If deep structure is deeper than thought previously<br>
then it is closer to semantic representation <br>

2. Deep structure is too deep. <br>
— Deep structure is closer to surface structure <br>
than thought before: <br>
• in the 1965 model, passive sentences had the same <br> deep structure as active ones <br>
— Based on this, one could argue that the generalisaiton <br> brough by deep structure could have been brough otherwise. <br>
— Arg 1: the rule of stating that x has a passive form <br>
can be accomodated through the lexicon, no need <br>
for deep grammer: the lexicon of "I open the pen" <br>
allows for "The pen was opened by me". <br>
— Arg 2: many of the functions performed by deep <br> structure were not in fact syntactical at all. <br>
• because linguistist could not form a rule <br>
to handle all cases of reflexive sentences in <br>
a syntactical fasion. <br>


### Semantics and meaning: 

#### Semantics vs other stuff:
1. Semantic elments related with sentences: <br>
— Sentence meaning <br>
• it is one among the factors involved in interpreting <br> an utterence in a context. <br>
— Interpretation of an utterence. 

2. What falls under grammatics: <br> 
— An utterence has a meaning, a grammatical component<br>
but it can convery more than this meaning, it  can <br>
also convey additional information. <br> 
— This additional information does not fall under grammer <br>
while ignoring syntactical and phonological form <br>
— The interpretaiton of an utternce is not determined <br> by the rules of grammer alone: <br>
• e.g. "I wonder if x or y wone the election" <br>
"x will not win". In this case, it is clear <br>
that the utterrer meant "y will win". <br>
However, this is not the literal meaning of the <br>
statement since in another context the sentence <br>
has another meaning <br.>

##### Additional
— Meaning of a sentence=set of porpositions <br>
— propositions= abstract obj representing semantic structures <br>

#### Entailment and meaning.
1. The entailments of a declarative sentence are those proposi- tions that can be inferred from it in isolation from any context
2. The meaning of a sentence seems to be the set of <br> propositions it entailes. (By uttering a snetence <br>
once commits oneself to a large set of utterences) 
3. Through entailment one can determine: <br>
— the synonimous, contradictory, tautological <br>
sentences. <br>
— 2 sentences are synonimous iff they have the same <br>
set of entailments. <br>
— see pages 152/153, page 53 of reader for the examples <br> on contradiction and tautological <br>
— a sentence may be said to be ambiguous if it may be <br> conjoined to its own denial without the result being necessarily <br> a contradiction. <br>

####  Problem with entailment:
1. If x and y have the same entailments, it is not <br>
always the case that they are synonimous <br>
— sentences which are utteredable in diff context <br>
even if same entialment <br>
— Thus, there needs to be a difference between <br>
logical entailment and semantic entailment. <br>
2. There exists cases in which pragmatically <br>
a synonimous set of sentences may differe <br>
depending either on context since pragmatically <br>
one assigns different importance to each entailment <br>
of a proposition <br>
3. It forces one to state that all sentences <br>
with the same entialment must have the same <br>
meaning. <br> 
— Thus, it allows no distinction between rules of <br> logical inference and rules of grammer proper. <br>

#### Solution: Ordered Entailments:
1. What Chomsky wants to argue: <br>
— What we are going to argue is that the semantic <br> rules of the grammar impose an internal <br>
structure‘on the entailments of a sentence, <br> 
and that two sentences which share their entailments, <br> but structure themdifferently, should no longer be <br> regarded as synonymous. <br>
— Structure of entialments affects the proccess <br>
of pragmatic interpretation. <br>
2. What question does he need to answer? <br>
— what type of structure is involved in the semantic <br> analysis of a sentence? <br>
— what mechanisms are used for imposing this structure?<br>
• He will argue that this structure is a logical one <br>

## Forth Reading:

1. 
> What we are going to argueis that <br>the semantic rules of the grammarimpose an internal structure <br>‘on the entailments of a sentence, and that two sentences which <br>share their entailments, but structure them differently, should no<br> longer be regarded as synonymous.
<p> !!!Different structure also has a pragmatic aspect of the <br> meaning of the statement!!.

2. 
If this approach is correct, then we need to answer these:<br>
(a) what type of structure is involved in the semantic <br>  analysis of a sentence. <br> 
(b) what mechanisms are used for imposing this structure? 
3. We argue that:
    1. this structure is a logical one
    2. the mechanism for deriving it involves:
        1. lexical
        2. syntactical
        3. phonological form
4. This substitution operation is done on <br>
surface grammer.
5. Poitn 4 =
> the set of entailments obtained from surface structure <br> in this way the grammatically specified entailments <br> of a sentence
6. To determine which sentences are accepted <br>
as properly synonimous, this criterion to be used:
> the range of questions to which it would be an acceptable <br> answer. 
> (42) Who stole three horses? <br>
(42) itself bears a semantic relationship to (43):<br>
(43) Someone stole three horses.<br>
(43) in some sense specifies the range of acceptable <br> answers to (42), in that any acceptable answer to <br>(42) must itself entail (43). <br> 
Thus (39), which entails (43), is an acceptable answer,<br> while (44), which does not,is not:<br>
(44) ?The earth is flat.
7. There is a hierarhiccal subordination <br>
of entailments according to a logical <br>
structure. 

> If we now modify the definition of synonymy so that <br>only sen- (ences which share their grammatically <br>specified entailments are synonymous, this difficulty is overcome.<br>

### Phonetics:
1. background: the statement with no stress 
2. focal scale: the possibilities of placing the stress.
3. depending on where the stress is placed, <br>
the entailment with highest importance changes <br>
each part of the statement pinpoints to a <br>
different entailment. 
4. 
> Two words will be synonyms if they make exactly the <br>same contribution to the entailments of sentences in <br>which they occur; they will be partial synonyms if every contribution made by one is also made by the <br>other; and so on.

## Reading 5: Handbook of Pragmatics:
### Truth-Condition Semantics:
1. meaning of sentences =truth conditions
2. correspondentism
3. Tarki-language-metalanguage theory
    1. object language =the language to be analysed
    2. metal langauge - the language through <br>
    the analysis is done. 
    3. e.g., S is true iff P
4. To not permit the combination of <br>
sentences with same truth value but <br>
unrelated:
5. Axioms need to be introduced:
    1. Reference axioms for names
        1. Sigmund Freud refers to Sigmund Freud
    2. Satisfaction axioms for predicates:
        1. Inteligent is satisfied by inteligent things.
    3. Connection axioms for syntactic structures:
        1. a is b is true iff that which a refers satisfies b. 
    4. Thus:
        1. Sigmund Freud is intelligent iff <br>
        Sigmund Freud is inteligent. 
6. It is obviosu that sentences are true <br>
in a T language, and the T sentence must reflect <br>
this: <br>
(a) Snow is white is true in English iff snow is white.

### The History of Truth-Condition Semantics:
> It was the philosopher of language Donald Davidson <br>who built on the work of Frege and Tarski <br>inproviding the sort of axiomatic truth-conditional <br>semantics for natural language outlined above. <br>In parallel with Davidson’s work, Montague developed <br>the model-theoretic embodiment of the <br>truth-conditional approach to the semantics of <br>naturallanguage.Thisinvolves the construction of <br>abstract mathematical models of those things in the <br>world which constitute the semantic values of the language <br> expressions.

1. — adding possible worlds to it, done by Kripke. <br>
modal logic can be carried also in natural language.<br>
(a) ‘Necessarily, horses are mammals’ is true iff ‘horses are <br> mammals’ is true in every possible world.

### Truth Condition Semantics and Pragmatics
1. language-mind theories, unlike the above, <br>
are focused on pragmatics, on intention-convention, <br>not truth-condtions.
2. Human communication is guided by maximes, and <br>
the meaning is implicated by context of utterence.
3. There exist indexical expressions, like "today" <br>
which are inherently dependent on the context <br>
of utternece.


### Non-Truth Conditional aspects of Semantics:
1. Truth-Condition Theory seems to not applly to <br>
not declarative statements.

### Denotation
1. Other empirical phen to take into account:
    1. meaning production. 
    2. judgements of semantic relation

#### Meaning Production
1. a procedure to determine how  <br>
    the reference of complex expressions <br>
    depends on the reference of their component. 
2. determin expressions other than NP
    1.  E.g. Pavarotti is an italian singer:
         1. VP = italian singer. NP = Pavoarotti
         2. VP adds properties to an NP. 
             1. e.g. = having a state of affairs <br>
             as its semnatic vlaue, in which: <br>
            Pavarotti has the property of <br>
            being an italian singer.
    2.  Non-referential NP's:
        1. every woman/no woman
        2. Non-referential NP play an <br>
            indirect role since they influence <br>
            the descipriotn of the state of <br>
            affairs in which they ocure.
        3. associating diff syntactic types <br>
            with different semantic  types.
            1. predication combines individuals <br>
                with properties to give states of <br>
                affiar. 
#### Sentence denotation is problematic:
1. e.g. 
    1. Pavarotti-is-French?
    2. If:Pavarotti: sings  <br>
         “O:chegelidestniilherT'wantto:be:there: <rb>
2. (1) = hypothetic state of affiars
3. (2) - conditional stae of affiars
4. Notions (1) and (2) are as unclear as <br>
    denotation, the notion we want to explain.
#### Semantic relatedness is poroblematic:
1. (s9)Someone is an italian singer 
2.  (s7) Pavarotii is an italan singer.
3. s7 is related with s9/s9 implict in s7/ <br>
    s9 is entialed by s7. 
4. to understand proerite/state of affaris, <br>
    they need to be elaborated sufficently <br>
    to explain a theory of entailement/ <br>
    semantic relatedness

5. Now  it is appropriate to ask the following  <br>     
   question: what would it mean for, say, a theory <br> of situations (or states of affairs) to be able to <br> supporta characterization of entailment?
    1. if s7 is true, s9 must be true. 
---
### Reference and Sense
1. We have assumed that sentences denote <br>
    state of affairs. This alongside to other <br>
    assumpetions leads to trouble:
2. Proof:
    1. let's assum expressions entailing each other <br>
    have the same reference
    2. If A is replaced with B and A and B have teh saem references, then A does not change regerence. 
    3. (s11)the sister of john
    4. (s12)the sister of Mary's husband

3. I f x and y entail each other, they <br>
    must have the same reference (58)
4. sense = intension
5. reference = extension
6. Arguments for Sense/Refernce distinction:
    1. Evening star/Morning Star
    2. opaque contexts
        1. Lorem believes that "grass is green"
        2. the truth value of:
            1. "grass is green"
            2. does not determine the truth of:
                1. the entire sentence.
7. Criticisms:
    1. For sense&reference to help:
        1. both the extension and intension <br>
           need ot be compositional. 
        2. we need to take into account:
            1. entailment
            2. presupositions
            3. as semantic relations.      
    2. Sense refers to propostions:
        1. what is a proposition/thought?

---

###  Truth          
1. To understand meaning of 1 w,
    1. one needs to see it in a context,
        1. context = its relation with other w.
        2. point to "Pavaroti" has the <br>
           meaning of pointing to a human. 
           1. one needs to have the concepte <br>
               "human" for "Pavaroti" to point <br>
               to the same thing. 
    2. sentences = smalles autonomous units in <br>
       a language. 
2. Frege: Only in the context of a sentence words <br>
    have meaning.
    1. What is a sentence?
        1. of diff kinds:
            1. delcarative and etc
        2. sentences depend on context of utterence
            1. I am tired. 
            2. in a context x, a sentence y <br>
               has a specific truth value. 
            3. we assume that "I am tired" <br>
               has a fixed context. We <br>
               select one context of the s. 
            4. we know the conditions under <br>
               which the sentence is ture, even <br>
               if we don't know wether <br>
               the sentence is true. 
            5. condition under which s is true:
                1. = when to asing truth to s. 
            6.  complete tarski schema (p63):
                1. For any S in L and any v,S <br>
                 is true in v if and only if (iff)p.
            7. sentece meaning is not all about <br>
               its turht value, but without truth <br>
               value we cannot understand its meaning <br>
            8.  S:meansp= df S is true in v iff p.
                1. p is elusive (what is a thought?)
                2. "iff p" describes the conditions <br>
                   under which p is true. 
                3. under this view meaning = truth value

### The Fragment of F1
1. semnatics of propositional calculus
2. N-V = noun-verb or N-V-N sequence
    1. = atomic sentences
3. complex sentences are obtained by:
    1. joining
    2. disjoining
    3. negating 
    4. other sentences. 

#### Syntax of F1:
1. notation:
    1.  S = sentence
    2. VP = verb 
    3. Vt = transitive verb
    4. Vi = intransivit verb
2. The rules(21) produce sentences <br>
   like (22)
   1. for (22a) associate with them:
        1. structures like in 23.
3. point 21 =rules:
    1. S --> VP
    2. S --> S conj S
    3. S --> neg S
    4. VP --> VtN 
    5. VP --> Vi
    6. N --> Pavarotti, Sophia Lorens, James Bond
    7. Vi --> is boring, is hungry, is cute
    8. Vt --> likes
    9. cong --> and, or
    10. neg --> it is not the case that
4. 22:
    1. Pavarotti is hungry, and it is <br>
    not the case that James Bond likes Pavarotti.
    2. It is not the case that Pavarotti <br>
     is hungry or Sophia Loren is boring.

![23:](/assets/images/2022-04-14-16-50-20.png)

![](/assets/images/2022-04-14-16-51-14.png)

#### Semantics for F1:
1. compositionality
    1. look at the semantic value of small parts
    2. provide algrotith for combining them
2. "S[v]= 1"= S is true in v
3. However, some semnifcations are ambigous:
    1. "It is not the case that Pavarotti <br>
     is hungry or Sophia Loren is boring."
        1. what does the negation negate.
        2. syntactical ambiguites correspond <br>
           to the semantic ones. 
    2. to avoid ambiguity:
        1. we should not interpret terminal strings.
        2. we should interpret:
            1. trees
            2. labeled bracketing
    3. interpreting:
        1. nouns
        2. intransitive verbs = 1 place predicates
        3. transitive verbs = 2 placed predicates

4. on interpreting
    1. regarding extensions:
        1. extension of proper name 
            1. = remains the same
        2. extenion of a predicate
            2. = varies on circumsntace
    2. logical operators:
        1. and
            1. see page 70 for interesting case. 
        2. or
            1. inclusive 
                1. more general than exclusive
                2. this is semantic
            2. exclusive
                1. this is not semantic:
                    1. it is deduced by extasemantic <br> elements:
                        1. extrasemantic = pragmatic
        3. it is not the case that
        4. each has their truth-table
        5. in our theory we give semantic value <br>
           to the operators.
        6. operators = connectives
            1. connectives =functions that map <br>
             truth values. 
            2. function = a systematic connection <br>
               betwee specific inputs and outputs. 

               ![](/assets/images/2022-04-15-00-48-20.png)

            3. operators = abstract objects as <br>
               the semantic values of logical words.
               1. meaning of conjunction:
                1. a function that maps truth v on <br>
                   truth values. 
                2. most languages have these operators.
    3. Now an interperetation rule <br>
       is needed for each syntactic rule. 
       1. this will guarantee that any <br>
          syntactically valid tree is <br>
          interpretable.
        ![](/assets/images/2022-04-15-00-55-46.png) 

        2. sentence content = relation between <br>
